# Reputation

The Ischia reputation system, used to evaluate and score users on the blockchain, is an innovative approach that enhances trust and supports various business and social activities.

### Reputation System

1. **Verification and Credential Linking**:
    - Users must verify their Twitter accounts or have a certain score on their on-chain address
    - Integrate on-chain and off-chain data to authenticate users more effectively.
    - Allow users to link their GitHub account to their on-chain address to enhance their reputation score.
2. **Airdrop Applications**:
    - Utilize reputation scores to distribute airdrop tokens, NFTs, and pass cards based on user behavior on the blockchain.
    - Create tiers of reputation that unlock different levels of airdrops, encouraging positive on-chain activity.
3. **Know Your Customer (KYC)**:
    - Reputation-based KYC system where users with higher scores are granted faster and more streamlined access to services.
4. **Credit Scoring**:
    - Credit scoring mechanism that uses on-chain and  off-chain data to assess the creditworthiness of users for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

### The Storage Layer of Data

- **EigenDA Integration**:
    - Use EigenDA to store and manage the bound data securely and efficiently.
    - Ensure that the data is immutable and verifiable on the blockchain
- IPFS **Integration**
    - Use IPFS to store Data points
- Local DB
    - Distributed data cluster
